Create a table that keeps track of roles, for example we 
could have: ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER
A method that assigns roles to various users, a user can have multiple roles.

This way only the administrator role can add the file and update the data,
and the user role can only visualize things

I would also have done the refresh part of the TOKEN
